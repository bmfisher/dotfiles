### .bashrc
Nice terminal prompt with git branch.  `GPG_TTY` is useful for signing your commits.
`EDITOR=vim` lets you use vim as your git editor for interactive merges / rebases.

### .vimrc
A combination of settings that significantly improve the vim experience.  There are certainly more out there.
Some nice remaps included as well as the PaperColor theme and a clear background.
[Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-appearance#background-image) is pretty neat and allows for custom background images with scaled opacity.
Below is an example looking at the Airflow repository with NerdTree and vertically split panes open.

### terminal_settings.json
[Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/profile-appearance#background-image) is pretty neat and allows for custom background images with scaled opacity.
In the spirit of vim navigation, I added keybindings to my Windows Terminal to allow for quickly splitting multiple panes and resizing them.
